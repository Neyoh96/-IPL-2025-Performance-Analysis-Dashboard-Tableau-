 IPL 2025 Analysis Dashboard Performance (Tableau).
 Project Overview

The proposed project includes an interactive Tableau dashboard that can be used to analyze the performance of batting in the IPL 2025. The dashboard offers all-purpose picture of the performance of the players based on the important data in the field of cricket including the number of runs made, centuries, half-centuries, strike rate, number of balls faced, 4s and 6s, and number of matches.

This project aims at converting raw cricket data to actionable information through data visualization and business intelligence tools.

 Key Objectives

Compare the performance of the players in terms of the number of runs scored.

Find the best performing batsmen of IPL 2025.

Find efficiency in batting through the use of strike rate and balls faced.

Measuring uniformity using 50s, 100s and matches played.

Underline boundary-hitting skill (4s 6s)

 The most important lessons learnt with the dashboard include:
 Most Runs Scored

Sai Sudharsan tops the table with 759 runs which shows a high degree of consistency.

The leading performers are Virat Kohli, Shubman Gill, Surya Kumar Yadav and Mitchell Marsh.

The allocation illustrates that there is a significant disparity between the elite performers and others.

 Centuries by Player

KL Rahul is the one who has the most number of centuries.

The majority of players have 0-1 centuries and this helps to underline the rarity of high-impact innings.

 Matches Played

Such players like Prabhsimran Singh and Shreyas Iyer have had the highest number of matches and have proved to be durable and dependable by the team.

The number of matches puts total runs and strike rate in perspective.

 Boundary Analysis (4s & 6s)

Sai Sudharsan is leading in fours which depicts good ground play.

Surya Kumar Yadav tops in the sixes, and this indicates explosive power batting.

Boundary metrics obviously delineate the difference between anchors and power hitters.

 Strike Rate (HS)

There are high strike rates of Shreyas Iyer and Mitchell Marsh, which mean aggressive scoring.

To have the efficiency of scoring, strike rate analysis is useful, rather than volume.

 Balls Faced

Sai Sudharsan experienced most balls and this further proves his status as a consistent top-order batsman.

High balls encountered with high runs represent consistency and stamina.
